    <h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm JaviVara</h1>
    <h3 align="center">I am passionate about full-stack application development. 
        I enjoy bringing to life the ideas and dreams I have and understanding the workings of everything. 
        This has led me to learn programming to understand how things around me function. 
        Currently, I am working on developing my own video game.</h3>
